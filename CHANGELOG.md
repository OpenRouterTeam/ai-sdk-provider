### Patch Changes

- [#214](https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/ai-sdk-provider/pull/214) [`f29f61f`](https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/ai-sdk-provider/commit/f29f61f298294e7b44fdbc160870e13e6b411117) Thanks [@subtleGradient](https://github.com/subtleGradient)! - Add changeset support for automated release management. This replaces the manual version bump and GitHub Release process with an automated workflow that creates version PRs and publishes to npm when merged.
