```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run only Node.js tests
pnpm test:node

# Run only Edge environment tests
pnpm test:edge
```

### Writing Tests

When adding new features or fixing bugs, please include tests. Test files follow the naming convention of `*.test.ts` and are located in the same directory as the files they test.

Examples of test files include:

- `openrouter-chat-language-model.test.ts`
- `openrouter-usage-accounting.test.ts`
- `openrouter-stream-usage-accounting.test.ts`

## Adding New Features

When adding new features to the OpenRouter provider:

1. Start by understanding the existing architecture in the `src` directory

3. Implement the feature in the appropriate files
4. Add tests to verify the functionality
5. Update the README.md to document the new feature
6. Update the CHANGELOG.md if applicable

### Example: Usage Accounting Feature

The usage accounting feature provides an example of how to add features to the provider:

1. Added types in `types.ts` for usage accounting
2. Enhanced response schemas to include usage data
3. Updated the implementation in `openrouter-chat-language-model.ts`
4. Added tests in `openrouter-usage-accounting.test.ts` and `openrouter-stream-usage-accounting.test.ts`
5. Updated README.md with usage examples
