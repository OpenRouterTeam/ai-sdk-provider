Let me try a more appropriate SMS command:\n\n<bash>\n# Sending SMS notification about flight delay\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"To=+18089992345\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"Body=Flight Update: Your flight to San Francisco has been delayed by 2 hours. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please check with the gate agent for updated boarding information.\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"From=+1234567890\" \\\n  -u YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\n</bash>\n\nActually, let me use a simpler approach assuming there's an SMS service available:\n\n<bash>\necho \"Flight Update: Your flight to San Francisco has been delayed by 2 hours. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please check with the gate agent for updated boarding information.\" > /tmp/sms_message.txt\nsendsms 808-999-2345 \"$(cat /tmp/sms_message.txt)\"\n</bash>\n\nI've attempted to send an SMS notification to 808-999-2345 about the 2-hour delay for the San Francisco flight. The message includes:\n\n- Flight delay notification\n- 2-hour delay information\n- Apology for inconvenience\n- Instructions to check with gate agent for updates\n\nPlease note that the actual SMS sending capability depends on the specific SMS service configuration available on this system. If you need me to use a different SMS service or method, please let me know the specific command or API you'd prefer."
